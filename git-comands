 This is not to be used as an actual file but is more as a reminder for myself of the steps needed in the command line.
# I could probably mash this into a workable file.

# Get all current packages
npm list -g --depth=0

# Make a note of the packages. grunt and jshint are the important ones for me.

# Sometimes npm tells you that there is an update available. This can be done using the following:
npm i npm

# Now install latest
nvm install latest

# Now let's say node.js 10.0.0 was just installed.
nvm use 10.0.0

# The list should be empty but may inform you of an update available.
npm list -g --depth=0

# Again, sometimes npm tells you that there is an update available. This can be done using the following:
npm i npm

# Now re-install global packages.
npm install -g jshint
npm install -g grunt

# Sometimes, when you run grunt, you may get an error.

# Run the following command:
npm rebuild node-sass
